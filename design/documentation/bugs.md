BUGS

Role Based Bugs
---------------

- Student
	1. progress bar needs computed values
	2. show teacher name on the course cards
- Teacher
	1. Homework stuff and Grades both need to work before we can finish this view... 
		-student dash needs grades per student in a teacher's class, that means the dashboard page 
leads to another course selection with student progress inside their individual courses.
	2. Change homework tab to student dash tab when in not in student view
-Admin
	1. View is pretty good, only big issue for me is all the teacher stuff needs to happen here essentially

General Bugs
------------
- Login Screen Sizing Bugs
- Weird resizing bug if description for a course is too big (the weird placement of elements carries over to other pages)
- Delete button in courses for admin is covered by the clickable box that brings us to course infe (Derek)
- Lists for the add/remove student/teacher does not always load correct (happened after I added people to one course)
- Should NavBar go horizontal under the header images? progress bar along the end... It would kinda make it cleaner
- Make alerts for if add course/add assignment has incorrect user input
- Let's go to a simpler background maybe a grey to white diagonal fade
